# About my first personal project

### This project is a tic tac toe game that I wanted to code from scratch. In high school, one of my final projects was to write a small program, and I chose Tic-Tac-Toe. However, there were many issues with that program (one of them being that you could overwrite a piece another player placed down). I wanted to revisit this project idea a couple of years later and with a couple more tools under my belt to get a better sense of where I am at programming wise and to apply what I learned in previous courses in college. This project will be just one of many that I hope to create, and will definitely be on the simpler side compared to what I want to create in the future.
